Auto Skip Intro, Recaps for NetFlix, Prime video and disney plys

It is very tedious to skip those long intro sequences and recaps on Netflix and Amazon Prime, you have to press the skip button each time.
And those Ads on Amazon prime are so annoying, right? No worries, we have got you covered.
We have a solution for our super lazy user. Now you can:
- Auto Skips intros and recaps on both Netflix and Prime
- Auto Skips credits and play next episode on Prime
- Auto Skips "Continue watching on Netflix"
- Auto Skips Ads on Prime
